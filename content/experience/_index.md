My career roots formed at [MITRE](mitre), where I fulfilled a cybersecurity scholarship as an engineer. There, I worked on several impactful efforts, including the industry-transforming [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org)&reg; framework, while gaining hands-on experience in detection engineering, adversary emulation, and security research. After several research initiatives required custom endpoint monitoring tools, I realized that directly contributing to the industry was the ideal way to broaden my impact on the cybersecurity space.

This led me to [Endgame](endgame) research and development, where I had direct impact on its endpoint security solution. On that team, I authored numerous detections and architected the Event Query Language (EQL), a stateful, real-time rule engine designed to detect and prevent malicious behavior on endpoints. To incorporate EQL across the product, I worked directly with several engineering teams and stepped into a backend engineering role to ensure its success.

Following Endgameâ€™s acquisition by [Elastic](elastic), integrating the Event Query Language (EQL) into the Elastic Stack became a critical initiative. Bringing EQL to Elasticsearch required embedding myself in another team, to directly develop and guide its implementation. On the endpoint side, I stepped in to to lead the design of a custom interpreter, enabling faster real-time preventions and integration with the Elastic agent. While these efforts were highly impactful to the company, I still sought a broader impact on both product and engineering.

Now at [Sublime](sublime), I leverage my leadership, engineering expertise, and cybersecurity background to tackle complex problems while building a next-generation email security platform.
