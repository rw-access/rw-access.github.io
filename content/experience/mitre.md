During my time at [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org), I contributed to several impactful projects that shaped modern cybersecurity practices. As part of the team that developed the industry-transforming [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org) &reg; framework, I worked on initiatives that bridged defensive and offensive security operations, building tools and techniques still used across the industry.

## Roles

### Senior Cyber Security Engineer
_Apr 2015 - Jan 2017_

- **CASCADE Project Lead**: Created and led development of an application to automatically correlate and triage detected malicious activity on endpoints.
- **Adversary Emulation**: Performed red teaming for MITRE and government sponsors, leveraging ATT&CK&reg; and novel techniques to improve organizational resilience.  
- **Custom Sensor Development**: Designed and implemented a Windows endpoint sensor to detect and prevent malicious credential access.
- **CALDERA Development**: Developed and patented CALDERA, a platform to automate adversary emulation based on ATT&CK&reg; techniques.  

### Cyber Security Engineer
_Jun 2013 â€“ Apr 2015_

- **Detection Engineering**: Authored novel analytics for the [Cyber Analytics Repository](https://car.mitre.org) to reduce attacker dwell time and built custom tooling to enhance blue team investigation processes
- **API anomaly detection**: Built software that encompassed a Windows driver and service to hook and trace Windows APIs, along with analysis to detect anomalies in system call flows with symbol matching.
- **Core Research Contributions**: Collaborated on several neighboring projects tied to ATT&CK&reg;, advancing both detection and response strategies.

## Recognitions

- **Network Attack Simulation Systems and Methods**: Patent for CALDERA (US #10218735, granted on 2019-02-16)
- **Program Recognition Award**: For outstanding contributions to an adversary emulation program for a government sponsor
