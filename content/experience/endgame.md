During my time at [Endgame](https://www.endgame.com), I worked on the research and development team for the endpoint detection and response (EDR) product. Although I was involved with a wide range of projects, my primary impact centered around the Event Query Language (EQL), a stateful rule engine for both live and historical processing, which became a core offering in the product.

## Roles

### Senior Security Researcher
_Feb 2018 – Oct 2019_

- **Endgame Reflex**: Coordinated with multiple teams across Endgame’s stack to deliver Reflex, which spanned backend, rule engine, and endpoint integration.
- **Detection engineering technical lead**: Provided expertise for event-driven detection, which included the ecosystem around detection engineering, spanning from development to production.
- **Detection ecosystem**: Matured the detection ecosystem by creating pipelines for CI/CD for new detections, to ensure quality of new detections, while mitigating degradations of logic.


### Security Researcher
_Jan 2017 – Feb 2018_

- **Event Query Language (EQL)**: Created EQL and the accompanying rule engine for stateful and temporal matching of suspicious activity on an endpoint, with live or historical processing.
- **Detection Engineering**: Contributed to initial detections for Endgame's rule engine, improving the effectiveness of its EDR solution.  
- **Backend Engineering**: Developed Endgame Resolver, which constructed process trees of event activity when triaging alerts and significantly improved the triage workflow.
